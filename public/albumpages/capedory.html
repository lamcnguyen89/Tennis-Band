                    To one who's spent the night at sea
                    Adrift in the shallows, a modest repose

                    Salty marsh fed by the tidal stream
                    Look down the flush
                    Sleeping deep in the brush
                    The night brings the hush
                    I can hear the current
                    Hidden by the knees of the cypress trees
                    The insects chirping underneath the leaves
                    When you kiss me, you really kiss me
                    Tell me how can you resist me
                    Did we ever reveal?
                    This is all that we need
                    Did we ever reveal?
                    This is all that we need
