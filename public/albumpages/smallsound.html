                    It's wrong, I know
                    But I can't let go

                    You were always quick to judge
                    Baby, you were slow to love
                    It hurts, I know,
                    But I can't let go

                    Timothy, say something sweet to me
                    Sai it slowly until you believe
                    Tell me that you find increasingly

                    Seems like nature cannot help

                    A hard heart will make a man blind
                    And a hard heart gets harder with time

                    So easily upstaged
                    But really I'm amazed

                    With eyes alight
                    And her hair so bright
                    Like I'll never find

                    She might leave the mark

                    Hard to be self aware

                    It's when she's close
                    That I feel the most

                    He was a heart-breaker
                    He was a heart-breaker

                    No less, I was a name at that time
                    She was a poet with hair that shined
                    I never thought I could make you mine
                    Afraid to reach out and then resign

                    One-hundred loves will make you bold
                    One-hundred more will make you cold
                    Oh, he was a heart-breaker And I will laugh until I'm tired
                    I will battle with a strange desire

                    I watched each girl come and go
                    For years I waited but could not show
                    One-hundred lovers ago
                    Back then I loved him and now you know
