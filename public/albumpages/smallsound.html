                            So easily upstaged<br>
                            But really I'm amazed<br>

                            With eyes alight<br>
                            And her hair so bright<br>
                            Like I'll never find<br>
                            Never find anything so divine<br>

                            Make an entrance at the doorway, ooh ay<br>
                            Best not to remember<br>
                            That baby, it ain't easy<br>

                            It's when she's close<br>
                            That I feel the most<br>
                            Like I'll never find<br>
