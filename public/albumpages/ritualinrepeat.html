                    Night Vision

                    The taste of sweet wine
                    The way you keep time
                    Makes me feel light

                    Don't trust your magic
                    Can't change your habits
                    So let's be light

                    Hey, oh, oh, oh

                    The way you hold me
                    Careful unfolding
                    Makes me feel light

                    It's not surprising
                    We go on rising
                    All through the night

                    Looking across the street lights
                    See the colors they obscure
                    Straining your night vision
                    For a chance to pierce the heavens
                    In the darkened light
                    Watching through the moonlight
                    Feel the softness of the air
                    Sleeping in the shadows
                    Of the heavens
                    So expansive in the waning light

                    The taste of sweet wine
                    The way you keep time
                    All through the night

                    Don't trust your magic
                    Can't change your habits
                    So let's be light

                    Looking across the street lights
                    See the colors they obscure
                    Straining your night vision
                    For a chance to pierce the heavens

                    Sleeping in the shadows
                    Of the heavens
                    So expansive in the waning light

                    I knew all the love songs
                    I knew all the love songs
                    I knew all the love songs
                    I knew all the love songs
                    I knew all the love songs
                    I knew all the love songs
                    I knew all the love songs

                    Looking across the street lights
                    See the colors they obscure
                    Straining your night vision
                    For a glimpse of something pure
                    Wandering through the moonlight
                    Feel the softness of the air
                    Sleeping in the shadow
                    Of the heavens, so expansive in the waning light

                    I'll never work for free
                    No I can't give up
                    It never belongs to me
                    I'll never work for free
                    Like an incantation I've been repeating

                    Looking back from the outer edge I'm still the same
                    Looking back from the outer edge I've changed my name
                    Just to stay the same
                    Just to stay the same

                    Fell in love with the traveling man

                    Got me looking for love

                    Little sympathy
                    Cause a long way back never comes easily
                    Even a young girl knows
                    That the first sign of love falls flat right where the cold wind blows
                    A single syllable contains my history
                    Never know what word could mean so much to me

                    Fell in love with the traveling man
                    I'll make him mine
                    Do whatever I can

                    Touching me with such sweet blindness
                    Hiding where our past can't find us
                    Need to find you another door
                    Oh baby I need more
                    I can't live on metaphors
                    Oh baby I need more

                    Fell in love with the traveling man
                    Gonna make you mine

                    That's why I chose matrimony yeah

                    Oh I'll never want to feel ashamed
                    I just can't bear that kind of pain

                    There is a need always divided yeah

                    You were always quick to judge
                    Baby, you were slow to love
                    It hurts, I know

                    Timothy, say something sweet to me
                    Say it slowly until you believe

                    Baby, you are either-or
                    And I'm the other at the door
                    It's wrong, I know

                    I ain't afflicted with a mind
                    That's either feminine or kind
                    Our history is incomplete
                    Your memory's been cruel to me
                    Oh darling now

                    The way is so far and it won't come easily

                    Youth has no sorrow
                    But your love can remove

                    A watcher is at the gate
                    An eager listener
                    Woods long forgotten
                    That may be exhumed

                    Steadfastly keeping
                    You were so resolute
                    When my ideas are rushing pas mal
                    And your look does not bear a reproof
                    Your look does not bear a reproof

                    Here bring your wounded heart
                    Here tell your anguish
                    Come my disconsolate
                    And be renewed

                    Steadfastly keeping

                    When my ideas are rushing pas mal
                    And your look does not bear a reproof
                    Your look does not bear a reproof

                    That's your way

                    All these simple melodies
                    Find their way into your memory
                    This will never be my song
                    This one was meant for you all along
                    It's nothing profound
                    Just as we turn, ah

                    Lay neglected in the glaring light
                    I will always be your girl
                    In the still point of the turning world
                    But this isn't my song

                    I will be your history

                    Like the sacred mysteries
                    They're all the same

                    Dark [?]
                    That throw their fragrance round
                    Roots that clutch [?] through the dust
                    Below the ground

                    Silver moon is turning
                    Now I feel the glow

                    Lift your bellies high
                    My solar on the rise See a miracle
                    But my baby don't believe
                    If that gift is a given
                    You better not receive

                    There's a hymn within
                    Singing all the end

                    Lift your bellies high

                    Some things just slip from my mind
                    Sweet memories leave me blind
                    Just like a love song meant for the dead
                    How should the rite be read

                    I remember the warm embrace
                    I remember the way you taste in my mouth
                    Speak to me in three quarter time
                    Oh my love is a slave to meter and line

                    Oh glorious, oh glorious, oh glorious

                    Hope of my heart a 'trembling
                    Like a winter flowers cold springing
                    I see her lying there unchanged
                    Drifting along the astral plane

                    Even as she was growing then
                    You could still find her looking into my mind
                    Heavy voice with a velvet look
                    There's a stillness in place of breath that she took
                    
                    Closer to me than my anatomy
                    Somethings just slip from my mind
