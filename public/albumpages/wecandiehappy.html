                    No Exit

                    I got a little bit left
                    I know that I can give a little bit up
                    I got a little bit left
                    I know that I can give a little bit up

                    It's starting all over again
                    I feel my heartbeat quickening
                    I make a mistake, they all missed it
                    He's prowling around in the night
                    Into his shadow wherever we go
                    Whatever I need to survive

                    We go down, down to the deep void
                    Right back into place, I can breathe again
                    We go down, down to the beat, boy
                    Right back into place
                    From where we are, we're never gonna come back
                    From where we are, we're never gonna come back

                    I am ecstatic like a hymn
                    And let the feelings disappear
                    Apocalyptic, my own mistake
                    I'm moving right into the end
                    Under his shadow, wherever we go
                    Our futures again and again

                    We go down, down to the deep void
                    Right back into place, I can breathe again
                    We go down, down to the beat, boy
                    Right back into place
                    From where we are, we're never gonna come back
                    From where we are, we're never gonna come back

                    I know that I can give a little bit up
                    I got a little bit left
                    I know that I can give a little bit up

                    We could die tonight
                    We could die tonight
                    Oh my God, I feel like I'm dying
                    Die tonight
                    We could die tonight
                    Oh my God, I feel like I'm dying

                    From where we are, we're never gonna come back

                    Born to Be Needed

                    Baby, I was born to be needed
                    Baby, I was born to be needed

                    I always resisted convictions and mister, misses
                    But I'd do it, do it, do it again
                    Do it, do it, do it again
                    Immune to biology
                    It's a lonely road to autonomy
                    But I would do it, do it, do it again
                    Do it, do it, do it again

                    Why should I deny myself?
                    Never really cared about my health
                    The simple kind of life
                    Cuts through me like a sharpened knife

                    Baby, I was born to be needed
                    Baby, I was born to be needed

                    Mother heard, might do me good
                    At least that's been the word around the neighborhood
                    We're gonna do it, do it, do it again
                    Do it, do it, do it again
                    I know it's an old refrain
                    But the need hit me like a hurricane
                    I fall into it, do it, do it again
                    Do it, do it, do it again

                    Why should I deny myself?
                    Never really cared about my health
                    The simple kind of life
                    Cuts through me like a sharpened knife

                    Baby, I was born to be needed
                    If my heart can't take it, then maybe
                    I will give right into the feeling

                    Baby, I was born to be needed
                    If my heart can't take it, then maybe

                    I Miss That Feeling

                    I can be true to you, even when losing
                    Every little thing I've ever known
                    And all of the love I've ever show
                    Something like pleasure, you'd never believe it
                    Every little need dismantling
                    Recorded by the needle of an EKG

                    I miss that feeling
                    Flicker hot and hovering
                    Like my own discovering
                    Eagerly, tenderly
                    I miss that feeling
                    Flicker spread into an itch
                    Into a burn, into a twitch
                    Slow and even

                    How to explain it or even contain it
                    When I feel that ragged edge descend
                    My heart splits open like a vent
                    Something like pleasure, you'd never believe it
                    Every little thing starts trembling
                    Recorded by the needle of an EKG

                    I miss that feeling
                    Flicker hot and hovering
                    Like my own discovering
                    Eagerly, tenderly
                    I miss that feeling
                    Flicker spread into an itch
                    Into a burn, into a twitch
                    Slow and even
                    
                    I miss that feeling, I miss that feeling
                    I miss that feeling, I miss that feeling

                    I've been looking at your diamond rings
                    And reflecting on the things they tell me
                    That they move too quick to misbehave
                    A dissenter cannot be a slave
                    I'm waiting on you to make my heart move
                    Baby, won't you come into me
                    Come and make my heart move

                    Time to light the lamp and trim the wick
                    I see crimson through a colored slit oh yeah
                    Waiting for the day I change my name
                    I've been told that doesn't mean a thing
                    I'm waiting on you to make my heart move
                    Baby, won't you come into me

                    Really make my heart move

                    Come and make my heart move baby
                    Ooh baby, I'm waiting for the magic
                    Come and make my heart move baby
                    Ooh baby, I'm waiting for the magic
                    Come and make my heart move baby
                    Ooh baby, I'm waiting for the magic

                    You were looking for devotion
                    Made of promises in motion
                    I can change, I can change, I can change
                    Never could find a way to explain

                    We're only building God
                    Until we have the one that we want

                    As I said with hands that quiver
                    Gesturing over our dinner
                    "I can change, I can change, I can change
                    Let me be what you need, it's okay"

                    We're only building God
