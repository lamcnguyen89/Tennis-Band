                    As the sun slips
                    Over my shoulder
                    I can tell I've
                    Been getting older
                    Drawn to you
                    Like the horizon
                    I'm the first one
                    To break the silence

                    I can tell I've been getting
                    I can tell, I
                    I can tell I've been getting
                    I can tell, I

                    As the sun slips
                    Over my shoulder
                    All my need is
                    Pulling me closer
                    Only you
                    Make this rock spinning
                    Off to nowhere
                    Much more appealing

                    On the edge of the earth
                    On the crest of a wave
                    How long can we stay like this?
                    Leaning in for one more kiss
                    I'm holding you so long
                    I will haunt you when I'm gone

                    Baby I'm fated but you will be waiting
                    I will have made it
                    But you'll be explaining what you
                    Think the world owes you
                    Looking for someone to carry you into
                    Futures that beckon but need to be followed through

                    I hope you're happy

                    And I need your touch, like
                    I need a bolt of lightning from the sky above, I've

                    Been thinking about you

                    Talking a lot
                    Like a prophet but there's no
                    Wisdom in what you've been saying
                    And I can't seem to
                    Get a read on you
                    Burning your bridges
                    And spreading around those
                    Rumors that sprout from the cracks
                    In the ground, oh no

                    I hope you're happy
                    I hope you're pleased
                    I thought you were a victim

                    Who could blame me?
                    Every time I hear your name I go crazy
                    Ooh, pretty baby
                    Every time I hear your name I go crazy

                    How to Forgive

                    You take your love so freely
                    Can't you go easy on me
                    Hard to resist, harder to give up like a habit
                    Why do you go losing control
                    What are you looking for? Oh whoa
                    All this noise when I need silence
                    Love shouldn't feel like violence
                    Swallow your pride, open up wide
                    Let the whole world in
                    Empty again punish a friend
                    Make 'em all suffer
                    It's so easy
                    I can't help it

                    How could I disguise the way that I'm feeling
                    I've got my reasons, I could give you a million
                    How could I disguise the way that I'm feeling
                    I've got my reasons, I could give you a million

                    My mind has been divided
                    And I've been questioning myself
                    Can't keep on hesitating
                    It's starting to affect my health
                    Hard to resist, harder to give up my bad habits
                    Why do I go losing control
                    What am I looking for
                    It's so easy
                    I can't help it
                    I can't help it
                    I can't help it

                    Well I know that I can't control
                    But it's so hard to let it go
                    All the worries, they keep coming back
                    And the disappointments from our past
                    I can't help it

                    How could I disguise the way that I'm feeling
                    I've got my reasons, I could give you a million (I can't help it)
                    I'd move on if I could only remember
                    All that it takes is just an act of surrender
                    How could I disguise the way that I'm feeling
                    I've got my reasons, I could give you a million (I can't help it)

                    I'll be the one to be undone
                    I'll go where the sun isn't shining
                    Once I was young
                    Those days are gone
                    Suddenly I'm thirty-three
                    And on a gurney
                    Apologies and obligations
                    All the myriad sensations compounding

                    Echoes in my brain
                    Echoed in refrain
                    Always a replay
                    Like a Grecian tragedy

                    Oh where the time goes
                    Who really knows

                    You said, "Get a doctor"
                    "My wife's going under"
                    She's off where the sun isn't shinning
                    I thought I would argue
                    Or cleverly bargain
                    It looks like I won't be going down stoically

                    Oh to love you and be loved
                    To have the final memory of you compounding
                    Echoes in my brain
                    Echoed in refrain
                    Echoes all the same way, oh
                    Way, oh
                    Way, oh
                    Way, ooh, ooh-ooh

                    Oh where the time goes
                    Who really knows
                    Oh where the time goes
                    Who really knows

                    Swimmer

                    Some summer you have planned for me
                    Look at all these tourist as they flock to the sea
                    Getting in the water like it's nothing, but it's
                    Not without a consequence
                    I hear it comes quite naturally
                    But that description doesn't fit with me
                    Not going over never going under
                    Not without a consequence
                    The narrows, the river
                    Empty into the sea
                    Some summer you have planned for me
                    Emptied into the sea

                    Some summer you have planned for me
                    Emptied into the sea
                    Such a good man, had a good job
                    I'd take up swimming for the patriarch
                    Now dispersed so casually like
                    Sediment into the sea
                    The swollen moon all flushed with red
                    One eclipse from the bay of the dead
                    It ain't right I'm telling you, it's
                    More than coincidence

                    One stroke at a time
                    On my way
                    Back to land
                    It's better for me
                    With my feet
                    In the sand

                    Some summer you have planned for me
                    Emptied into the sea

                    With my heart in my throat
                    And the sun in my face
                    Lying here in your arms
                    I know this is the place
                    I would never try to explain
                    How it felt when we kissed
                    Courting reason in dreams
                    While my body resists

                    I know my logic can lose you
                    But I think that we can get used to

                    My footsteps over the concrete
                    Blistering in June
                    My heart leaps over the concrete
                    Oh I live for you
                    Each footstep over the concrete

                    With my throat in my heart
                    And my face on the sun
                    In your arms, I will lay
                    'Til my dreaming is done
                    Buried under mountains of earth
                    On the crest of a wave
                    Courting reason in love
                    is a terrible waste

                    I know my logic can lose you
                    But I think that we could get used to

                    My footsteps over the concrete
                    blistering in June
                    My heart leaps over the concrete

                    Late Night

                    Late night
                    Carried by the wind
                    It took such a long time
                    To make up my own mind
                    Everything is changing
                    But I would not attempt to control you
                    I never could help myself
                    I waste my time
                    It's taking a toll on my health
                    I waste my own time
                    Like Mary Magdalene I'm on my knees again
                    But if you see me as a saint
                    You'd be mistaken
                    Late night turning into morning blue
                    It took such a long time
                    To make up my own mind about you
                    Now the sun hangs heavy
                    And I can't even lift my eyes
                    To where it sits indifferently
                    Unmoved, mover of the sky
                    I never could help myself
                    I waste my time
                    It's taking a toll on my health
                    I waste my own time
                    Like Mary Magdalene I'm on my knees again
                    But if you see me as a saint
                    You'd be mistaken
                    I am the master of my ship
                    My ship the master of the sea
                    Through a rhetorical distinction
                    I think I'm finally
                    Feeling free
                    For the first time
                    For the first time

                    Matrimony II

                    I only have certainty
                    When you hold my hand
                    There's so much I don't understand
                    Baby we've been orbiting
                    Each other helplessly
                    I guess that I blacked out
                    But remembered to move my mouth
                    So much for my vows
                    More concerned with here and know
                    No one knows of love that's slow
                    Held like the longest breath or
                    The gentle pull of gravity
                    That's being unto death
                    I can't go on living with a spark
                    That's only flickering
                    I only want that tenderness
                    With every moment left
                    I could never find something better
                    I even changed my name
                    By my side in every kind of weather
                    I'll never be the same
                    I could never find something better
                    I even changed my name
                    By my side in every kind of weather
                    I'll never be the same
                    Come closer you say
                    Black cats in the neighborhood
                    Aren't necessarily a sign of something
                    You know me so well
                    There goes the neighborhood
                    Let it all go burning down around us
                    No one knows of love that's slow
                    Held like the longest breath or
                    The gentle pull of gravity
                    That's being unto death
                    I can't go on living with a spark
                    That's only flickering
                    I only want that tenderness
                    With every moment left
                    To give, ohh
                    To give, ohh
                    I could never find something better
                    I even changed my name
