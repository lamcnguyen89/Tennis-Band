                            My mind has been divided<br>
                            And I've been questioning myself<br>
                            Can't keep on hesitating<br>
                            It's starting to affect my health<br>
                            Hard to resist, harder to give up my bad habits<br>
                            Why do I go losing control<br>
                            What am I looking for<br>
                            It's so easy<br>

                            Well I know that I can't control<br>
                            But it's so hard to let it go<br>
                            All the worries, they keep coming back<br>
                            And the disappointments from our past<br>
                            I can't help it<br>

                            I'd move on if I could only remember<br>
                            All that it takes is just an act of surrender<br>

                            Lying here in your arms<br>
                            I know this is the place<br>

                            How it felt when we kissed<br>
                            Courting reason in dreams<br>

                            My footsteps over the concrete<br>
                            Blistering in June<br>

                            Buried under mountains of earth<br>
                            On the crest of a wave<br>

                            Carried by the wind<br>
                            It took such a long time<br>
                            To make up my own mind<br>
                            Everything is changing<br>
                            But I would not attempt to control you<br>

                            I waste my time<br>
                            It's taking a toll on my health<br>
                            I waste my own time<br>
                            Like Mary Magdalene I'm on my knees again<br>
                            But if you see me as a saint<br>

                            Now the sun hangs heavy<br>
                            And I can't even lift my eyes<br>
                            To where it sits indifferently<br>
                            Unmoved, mover of the sky<br>

                            I am the master of my ship<br>
                            My ship the master of the sea<br>
                            Through a rhetorical distinction<br>
                            I think I'm finally<br>
                            Feeling free<br>
                            For the first time<br>
