                    Now, leave your hand in mine
                    The heat strikes me as divine
                    Seated here by my side
                    The day blurs into the night

                    Not that I'm aware of

                    Across the Saccharine Plain
                    Cracked and devoid of rain
                    I think of life without pain
                    To hide my hope from this scissors' strain

                    You love me to believe
                    Seeking shelter from the wind
                    It blows with strength that has no end
                    So small you seem within my hand
                    You gather strength to leave again
                    The storm is strong
                    But you carried on
                    And now it's gone
                    Seeking shelter from the wind
                    It blows with strength that has no end
                    So small you seem within my hand
                    You gather strength to leave again
                    Uhh

                    High Road

                    [Verse 1]
                    At two fish creek they come to meet
                    Weathered and edged by the summer heat
                    The sun is always in their eyes
                    They hold their glasses like a prize

                    [Verse 2]
                    On a clouded fair and gin they dine
                    They're always losing track of time
                    A swampy mangrove paradise
                    They import everything that's nice

                    [Verse 3]
                    Comfort is a word rarely heard
                    Wages are transient they look
                    For opportunity to grow
                    The better times they never show

                    [Verse 4]
                    By now their dreams have all been dreamt
                    All of their money has been spent
                    The crashing surf upon the ground
                    And no one ever hears a sound

                    [Verse 5]
                    A life of middling at best
                    Put that pro-touch-up to a rest
                    Was it a choice they do not know
                    The better times they never show

                    [Outro]
                    Paradise is all around
                    But happiness is never found
                    Paradise is all around
                    But happiness is never found

                    Little virgin clean and bright
                    Milk, white skin hidden from night
                    Unblemished are your private parts
                    Desire can't oppress your light

                    Lest your charms are all revealed
                    Then your power you may wield

                    Do not furrow that perfect brow

                    Little virgin sweetly made
                    Knows not of the plans we've laid
                    Guard the fragile flickering light
                    To extinguish as we like
                    Free from every wicked thing
                    You'll receive a diamond ring
                    Prepubescent wedding day
                    Thereupon you'll lay your head
